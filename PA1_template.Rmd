## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
summary(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
stepsByDay <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(stepsByDay, main = "Histogram for total number of steps taken each day", xlab = "Total number of steps", col = "red")

## Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
summary(stepsByDay)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}

## Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
averageActivity <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean)
plot(averageActivity$interval, averageActivity$steps, type="l", pch = 18, col = "blue", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps", main = "Average daily activity by interval")

## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
averageActivity[which.max(averageActivity$steps),]
```

## Imputing missing values

```{r}
## Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
sum(is.na(activity))

## Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
## Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
filledActivity <- activity

for (i in 1:nrow(filledActivity)) {
  
  if (is.na(filledActivity$steps[i])) {
    currentInterval <- as.numeric(filledActivity$interval[i])
    interval <- activity[filledActivity$interval == currentInterval,]
    filledActivity$steps[i] <- mean(interval$steps, na.rm = T)
   }

}

sum(is.na(filledActivity$steps))

stepsByDay <- tapply(filledActivity$steps, filledActivity$date, sum)

hist(stepsByDay, main = "Histogram for total number of steps taken each day", xlab = "Total number of steps", col = "red")

```

Mean and median for the data with NA's:

```{r}
summary(activity)
```

Mean and median for the data without NA's:

```{r}
summary(filledActivity)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
activity$day <- ifelse(weekdays(activity$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
averageActivity <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data = activity, FUN = mean)

library(ggplot2)
qplot(interval, steps, data = averageActivity, geom=c("line"), xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps", main = "Average activity by interval") + facet_wrap(~ day, ncol = 1)
```
